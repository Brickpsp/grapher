# Linker Engine

The linker engine is composed of 3 components:
- Definition of Links
- Linked Data Retrieval
- Setting Links

Let's explore how we can play with `Linked Data Retrieval` and `Setting Links`, assumming we already defined our links
using `addLinks()` method.

Each collection gets extended with a `getLink` function:
```js
const linker = Collection.getLink(collectionItemId, 'linkName');
```

A real life example (assuming you have a `direct` or `inversed` link with groups)
```js
const userGroupLinker = Meteor.users.getLink(userId, 'groups');
```

Linker is polymorphic and it allows you to do almost magical things. It is so flexible that it will
allow you to use it very naturally.

## Linked Data Retrieval

```js
const userGroupLinker = Meteor.users.getLink(userId, 'groups');

// fetching the groups for that user:
const groups = userGroupLinker.find().fetch();
// or for ease of use
const groups = userGroupLinker.fetch();
// or to filter the nested elements
const groups = userGroupLinker.find(filters, options).fetch();
// and again simpler
const groups = userGroupLinker.fetch(filters, options);

// and if you want to performantly get a count()
// because find() returns a good ol' Mongo.Cursor
const groups = userGroupLinker.find(filters, options).count();
```

This works with any kind of links from any side.

## Setting Links

This allows you to very easily link collections to each other, without relying on knowing the fields and how are they stored.
It also allows you to set links from any place `direct` and `inversed`, of any type `one` or `many` and `meta` links as well:


#### "One" Relationships

Performing a `set()` will automatically execute the update or insert in the database.

```js
const userPaymentProfileLink = Meteor.users.getLink(userId, 'paymentProfile');

userPaymentProfileLink.set(paymentProfileId);
// but it also works if you have the object directly if it has _id, for ease of use:
userPaymentProfileLink.set(paymentProfile);

// it works from the other side as well
const paymentProfileUserLink = PaymentProfiles.getLink(paymentProfileId, 'user');
paymentProfileUserLink.set(userId); // or a user object that contains `_id`
```

You can also `set` objects that aren't in the database yet:

```js
const userPaymentProfileLink = Meteor.users.getLink(userId, 'paymentProfile');

userPaymentProfileLink.set({
    last4digits: '1234',
});
```

This will insert into the `PaymentProfiles` collection and link it to user and it works from both `direct` and `inversed` side as well.

To remove a link for a `one` relationship (no arguments required):
```js
userPaymentProfileLink.unset();
// or
paymentProfileUserLink.unset();
```

#### "Many" Relationships

Same principles as above apply, with some minor changes, this time we use `add` and `remove`

```js
const userGroupsLink = Meteor.users.getLink(userId, 'groups');
userGroupsLink.add(groupId);
userGroupsLink.add(group); // object containing an _id
userGroupsLink.add({
    name: 1,
}); // will add the group to the database and link it accordingly
```

The methods `add()` and `remove()` also accept arrays
```js
userGroupsLink.add([
    groupId1,
    groupId2
]);

userGroupsLink.remove(groupIds)
```

The same logic applies, you can add array of objects that contain `_id` or array of objects without `_id`, or a mixture of them.

Ofcourse, the `remove()` cannot accept objects without `_id` as it makes no sense to do so.

#### "Meta" Relationships

Now things get very interesting, because `metadata` allows us to store additional information about the link,
it lets us **describe** the relationship. And again, this works from `direct` and `inversed` side as well, with the 
same principles described as above.

The `add()` and `set()` allow an additional parameter `metadata`:

```js
// one
const userPaymentProfileLink = Meteor.users.getLink(userId, 'paymentProfile');

userPaymentProfileLink.set(paymentProfileId, {
    createdAt: new Date()
});

// many
const userGroupsLink = Meteor.users.getLink(userId, 'groups');

userGroupsLink.add(groupId, {
    createdAt: new Date(),
})

// if you add multiple objects, they will receive the same metadata
userGroupsLink.add([groupId1, groupId2], {
    createdAt: new Date(),
})
```

Updating existing metadata:
```js
// one
const userPaymentProfileLink = Meteor.users.getLink(userId, 'paymentProfile');

userPaymentProfileLink.metadata({
    updatedAt: new Date()
});

// many
userGroupsLink.metadata(groupId, {
    createdAt: new Date(),
})
userGroupsLink.metadata([groupId1, groupId2], {
    createdAt: new Date(),
})
```

Updating metadata only works with strings or objects that contain `_id`, and it works from both sides.



## Conclusion

By using this Programatic API to set your links instead of relying on updates, it makes your code much simpler to read,
much easier to migrate in the future to a new database relational model.
