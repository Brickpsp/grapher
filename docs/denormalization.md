# Denormalization

Grapher allows you to denormalize your links, leveraging the power of `herteby:denormalize` package.
You can learn more about its capabilities here: https://github.com/Herteby/denormalize

You may need denormalization in such cases where:
1. You want to avoid another database fetch 
2. You need ability to perform complex filtering

This has some caveats that we'll explore, let's check out a simple example first:

```js
// Assuming Images of schema: {_id, path, smallThumb, createdAt}
import Images from '...';

Meteor.users.addLinks({
    avatar: {
        collection: Images,
        field: 'avatarId',
        type: 'one',
        denormalize: {
            field: 'avatarCache', // in which field to store the cache
            // what fields to cache from Images, this only works for fields and not links
            body: { 
                path: 1,
                smallThumb: 1,
            }
        }
    }
})
```

If you did not add this since the beginning of your app, you need to add this into your migration script:

```js
import {migrate} from 'meteor/herteby:denormalize'
migrate('users', 'avatarCache');
```

Now if you are doing the following query:
```js
const user = Meteor.users.createQuery({
    avatar: {
        smallThumbPath: 1,
    }
}).fetchOne()
```

Grapher will check to see if avatar's body is a subbody of the denormalized body. If yes, it will hit the cache,
leading to a single database request.

And the result will be as you expect it to be:
```
{
    _id: 'XXX',
    avatar: {
        _id: 'YYY',
        smallThumbPath: '/path/to/file.small.png'
    }
}
```

It works very well with nested fields, so you don't have to worry about that.

However, a query like this:
```js
const user = Meteor.users.createQuery({
    avatar: {
        smallThumbPath: 1,
        createdAt: 1,
    }
}).fetchOne()
```

Will result in a subsequent database request, because `createdAt` is not in the denormalized body. But if you swap it with `path` then it will hit the cache.

When the user sets a new Avatar, or the `Image` object of that Avatar gets updated. The cache gets automatically updated,
so you don't have to worry about anything. It's magical.

Denormalization works with any type of links `one`, `many`, `meta` whether they are `direct` or `inversed`.

We previously tackled the case where we needed `$postFilters` or `$postFilter` to retrieve some special kind of data:

Let's take a case: we want to retrieve only the users that have reviewed a book of a certain type, and inside `books` collection,
we have `reviewedByUserIds`.

```js
Books.addLinks({
    'reviewedByUsers': {
        type: 'many',
        collection: Meteor.users,
        field: 'reviewedByUserIds',
    }
})

Meteor.users.addLinks({
     'bookReviews': {
         collection: Books,
         inversedBy: 'reviewedByUsers',
         denormalize: {
             body: {
                 type: 1,
             },
             field: 'bookReviewsCache',
         }
     }
});
```

*Note that this case may not necessarily be the best example, this is just for illustration,
if you have a better example in mind, let us know so we can update this documentation.*

And now, I want to get all the users that have reviewed books of type `Drama`, because I want
to send them an email about a new book.

```js
const dramaticUsers = Meteor.users.createQuery({
    $filters: {
        'bookReviewsCache.type': 'Drama'
    },
    email: 1,
}).fetch();
```

Denormalization comes with a price:
1. It adds hooks to the database so it can properly update it, therefore a change somewhere can result
into additional computation.
2. If you are not careful it can lead to very big caches, which is not what you want unless you favor performance over storage.

The package also supports caching fields and caching counts. You can define those caches outside Grapher without a problem, and specify those fields in your query.

## Caution

If you want to use deep filters, it will not work with denormalized cache, you can use `$postFilter()` method for that.

Because if you put `$filters: {}` inside the body of the cache, it will regard it as a foreign field, and it will fetch the linked Collection for it.

A current limitation for denormalized meta links, is that we will no longer be able to store the `$metadata` inside the nested object, because that
would require additional fetching of the link storage, 

## Conclusion

Using denormalization can enable you to do wonderful things inside NoSQL, but also be careful because they come with a cost,
that may not be very noticeable in the beginning. But can also dramatically improve performance at the same time.

I suggest that they should be used to cache things that rarely change such as an user's avatar, or when you need to do
powerful and frequent searches, that otherwise would have consumed more resources.
